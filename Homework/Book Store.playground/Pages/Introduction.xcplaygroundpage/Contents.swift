 # Book Store

 This is a simple playground which is a shopping cart of an online book store.
 
 The shopping cart shows authors and books the user wants to buy.
 It shows the total price in the title bar.
 
 For example, I want to buy following books. Each books is represented by 
 a dictionary with 3 keys: `author`, `title`, and `price`.
 
 > You have to open the **Timeline view** if you cannot see the shopping cart.
