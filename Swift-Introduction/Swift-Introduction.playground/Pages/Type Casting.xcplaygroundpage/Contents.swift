 # Type Check and Casting
 
 Type casting is a way to check the type of an instance, or to treat that
 instance as a different superclass or subclass from somewhere
 else in its own class hierarchy.
 
 Type casting in Swift is implemented with the `is` and `as` operators.
 These two operators provide a simple and expressive way to
 check the type of a value or cast a value to a different type.

//: The Swift compiler would help you to check the casting between types.

//cat is Dog  // Uncomment to see the warning Xcode yields.

//let dog = cat as? Dog  // Check the warning and the value of `dog`
//let someDog = cat as Dog  // Uncomment to see the error Xcode yields.
//let someDog2 = cat as! Dog  // Uncomment to see the error Xcode yields.
let someCat = animal as? Cat // // Down-casting. Use `option+click` to see the type of `someCat`

 ## `Any` and `AnyObject`
 
 Swift provides two special types for working with nonspecific types:
 - `Any` can represent an instance of any type at all, including function types.
 - `AnyObject` can represent an instance of any class type.
 
 Use `Any` and `AnyObject` only when you explicitly need the behavior and capabilities they provide.
 It is always better to be specific about the types you expect to work with in your code.
 By making the type context clear, Swift could keep your code safe to execute.
