 # Automatic Reference Counting
 
 Swift uses Automatic Reference Counting (ARC) to track and manage your app’s memory usage.
 
 As the name implies, the ARC thing only applies to reference types.
 Reference counting only applies to instances of classes. Structures and enumerations
 are value types, not reference types, and are not stored and passed by reference.
 
 In most cases, this means that memory management “just works” in Swift,
 and you do not need to think about memory management yourself. However,
 in a few cases ARC requires more information about the relationships
 between parts of code in order to manage memory for you.

 `init` is the initializer which would be called when creating instances of a Type.
 `deinit` is the deinitializer, called when a reference type instance being freed.
